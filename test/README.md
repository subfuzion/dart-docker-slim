To run tests locally:

```shell
$ cd test
$ ./dartslim_test.sh
```

This will build an image for the test server, launch a container,
and run `dart test` against the container.

The tests simply confirm that a server is running in the container,
and responds to `test-ping` and `remote-test-ping` (to confirm DNS
queries work for sending requests to a remote host).

All local artifacts (image,
container) are deleted on test script exit.
